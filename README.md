# Zebra Wireless Display API

This repository holds the sample code linked to the blog post about the Zebra Wireless Display API.
Such API allow Developers to embed the wireless connection feature into their apps

The wireless connection is otherwise available for Administrators through a separate APK [at this link](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software/mobile-computer-software/wireless-workstation-connect.html?downloadId=a773e381-08bd-4062-9265-ceedaaca50e8).

# Mastering the ZWDS Wireless Display API

Wireless display experiences live or die by their connection lifecycle. The ZWDS (Zebra Wireless Developer Service) API for ZEC500-class devices centers on a small but critical set of calls that must be orchestrated correctly to deliver a smooth “extended” secondary screen experience. This post walks through the canonical sequence, expands on each stage, and offers patterns, diagrams, and practices you can adopt immediately.

I'm providing developers with two sample projects that exercise ZWDS APIs
- The first works with APIs separately, so that you must invoke the single APIs by pressing buttons in the guided sequence. This project is found in the "Engineering Sample" folder.
- The second is found in the "Developer Sample" folder and showcases the SCAN TO CONNECT use case (a QR code with the target display name must be scanned) and the TAP TO CONNECT use case, where the target screen name is sourced by the target device's NFC.

---

## Security
However, before diving into the APIs and their use cases, let's examine the ZWDS security feature. We wanted to implement a robust version of the wireless developer service, so, by design, ZWDS can only be invoked by administrator-enabled devices. This is a common paradigm for several Zebra services. 

### SECURE MODE

#### TOKEN USAGE
The security feature is enabled by default, meaning that unless it is intentionally disabled, any third-party app that wants to interact with the ZWDS needs to use a _token_ mechanism detailed below.

If the app calling the ZWDS APIs has not been allowed, an _Invalid Token/Caller_ error message is returned.

<img width="256" height="68" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf4a71bc-b056-46b2-9e85-fa21b811b8ac" />


In secure mode, any ZWDS API call must include a _token_, generated through the GetIntentSecureToken class. Refer to [`this line as an example of Token generation and application`](https://github.com/ZebraDevs/mcs_lumos_zwds_samples/blob/bb4b705128aca3e1302def31ba2c27fc4ac8ffbe/Engineering_Sample/POC-Sample/app/src/main/java/com/zebra/zwds/engsample/MainActivity.java#L121C32-L121C52) and to [this code](https://github.com/ZebraDevs/mcs_lumos_zwds_samples/blob/main/Engineering_Sample/POC-Sample/app/src/main/java/com/zebra/zwds/engsample/GetIntentSecureToken.java). Such a token generation procedure leverages the Zebra Delegation Scope mechanism, and the application using it needs to be allowed ahead of time.

For clarity, the token request/generation works by accessing a specific Content Provider, identified by the authority `content://com.zebra.devicemanager.zdmcontentprovider` and found at this URI `content://com.zebra.devicemanager.zdmcontentprovider/AcquireToken`. A query performed in this way

<img width="615" height="274" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66a56ddd-977e-4012-b3a0-f43b3e42b39e" />

returns a cursor, and the token is found in the first record, under the `query_result` column, as a string type.

#### ALLOWING AN APPLICATION TO REQUEST TOKENS
However, not any application can generate a token! An administrator needs to grant the token generation permission to the intended app by means of the following Access Manager action
- Service: "Allow Caller to Call Service"
- Service Identifier: "delegation-zebra-zwds-api-intent-secure"
- Caller Package Name: this is the applicationID of the application that will be granted access to the token generation; the applicationId is usually found in the build.gradle file of an Android Studio project.
  
  e.g. <img width="298" height="38" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82deceaa-6680-4bb2-baf5-2072c7422ef9" />
- Caller Signature: this is the first signature of the application's APK, in DER format, provided as a CRT file. Refer to [https://techdocs.zebra.com/sigtools/](https://techdocs.zebra.com/sigtools/) to learn how to extract a signature. I also made this online application available for APK signature retrieval; it works for most APKs: [https://cxnt48.com/apksig](https://cxnt48.com/apksig)

The following picture summarizes the Access Manager configuration required:

<img width="367" height="571" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84ad53f2-2052-41c2-a87a-3ae25089f0eb" />


### UNSECURE MODE
To use the ZWDS in an _unsecure mode_, just enable the service binding, e.g. through Stagenow like this:
- Work with an instance of the Access Manager
- Service Access Action: "Allow Binding to Service"
- Service Identifier: "delegation-zebra-zwds-api-secure-access-config"

<img width="366" height="733" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f93cb5a1-c393-41c7-85f0-6b66bf59486a" />

While in Unsecure Mode, ZWDS APIs can be called without requiring a token.

Making a similar call with action "Disallow Binding to Service", enables the security mode.

## Expanded State Machine View

Below is a more explicit than the provided success-only flow.
`For brevity W._D. stands for WIRELESS_DISPLAY`

stateDiagram-v2

    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Initialized : INIT_DEV_SERVICE

    Initialized --> CheckFlags : DISPLAY_CHANGE_CALLBACK_ON

    Initialized --> Idle : DEINIT_DEV_SERVICE
    Initialized --> Scanning : START_WIRELESS_D._SCAN

    state Scanning {
        direction LR
        [*] --> Discovery : GET_AVAILABLE_DISPLAYS
        Discovery --> Selection : Displays found
    }

    Scanning --> CheckFlags : User selects display
    

    state CheckFlags <<choice>>
    CheckFlags --> Connecting : [isAvailable & canConnect]


    Connecting : CONNECT_WIRELESS_DISPLAY
    Connecting --> Streaming : Connection Succeeded

    Streaming --> Streaming : GET_STATUS (Poll)
    Streaming --> Disconnecting : DISCONNECT_WIRELESS_DISP.

    Disconnecting --> Initialized : Disconnect Complete
```

The key steps to work with these APIs are summarized in the following lines:
- Initialize the service and enable the DISPLAY CHANGE CALLBACK. Callbacks are useful to detect changes in the display properties such as availability and connectability.
- Then START_WIRELESS_DISPLAY_SCAN search
- Collect the available displays by calling the GET_AVAILABLE_DISPLAYS periodically
  - Each returned item includes an available WIFI MAC ADDRESS and a DISPLAY NAME.
  - To connect to a specific display, the Connect API needs the WIFI MAC ADDRESS; however, users want to select a display by their NAME.
  - Your business logic needs to allow for a display NAME entry/scan, then you'll need to match such a NAME to its WIFI MAC ADDRESS.


  - Then refer to e.g. [`this ZEC500 sample code`](https://github.com/ZebraDevs/ZEC500-DEV-UG-SampleApp) to show a QRCode of the target display name. That QRCode will be scanned by the connecting app, which in turn will finally invoke the CONNECT_WIRELESS_DISPLAY API to complete the wireless connection.

- Before further proceeding, it's advised to STOP_WIRELESS_DISPLAY_SCAN, to save battery energy
- Also, wait for the callback to signal that `isAvailable==true` and `canConnect==true` 
- Eventually, invoke CONNECT_WIRELESS_DISPLAY by explicitly passing the `intent.putExtra("DEVICE_ID", deviceAddress);` found above and chose by the user.
  The CONNECT_WIRELESS_DISPLAY succeeds only if the target display properties `canConnect` and `isAvailable` are both `true`
- Finally, manage the release of the above resources.

## API Template

ZWDS APIs follow a common pattern that is explained in the following lines.
Let's take the `START_WIRELESS_DISPLAY_SCAN` API as an example.
Also, let's compare that API documentation with the actual code implementation 

<img width="400" height="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7892bd2b-e7ed-4eca-91a9-bbf9f9d046d6" /> <img width="410" height="290" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5657add-c351-478b-ae4d-a2023a3dde6f" />

- The API defines the Intent action (e.g. `new Intent("com.zebra.wirelessdeveloperservice.action.START_WIRELESS_DISPLAY_SCAN");`)
- The target package name is always `intent.setPackage(WIRELESS_DEV_SERVICE_PACKAGE);`, where `WIRELESS_DEV_SERVICE_PACKAGE = "com.zebra.wirelessdeveloperservice";`
- Then define the result that will be returned, as a pending intent and add it to the intent to be sent

  <img width="603" height="138" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/939e686a-78c0-4fee-b0b8-2f1bc78414a6" />
- Manage the secure token, if needed, as explained at the beginning of this blog
   <img width="604" height="80" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bab06b0c-cca7-4c0d-9d9c-8054fb2a65b7" />
- Finally, broadcast the intent as `sendBroadcast(intent);`

Act similarly for the other APIs.

 
## The Workflows (code module 'workflow')
As shared in this blog post's introduction, an additional sample project is made available to developers. It shows how to automate all the needed API calls according to two workflows: TAP TO CONNECT (where NFC tapping is involved) and SCAN TO CONNECT (where a barcode scanning is required).

I'll briefly describe such workflows in the following paragraphs.

### SCAN TO CONNECT
It's the most common use case.
Visually, this picture shows how it works

<img width="789" height="667" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8779124e-0bc3-4834-9421-9f7c2498ea33" />

- The screen is connected to ZEC500 and runs an app that displays the QR Code (screen's bottom-right)
- A tablet (Zebra ET401) in the foreground is connecting by scanning that QR Code

The logic here requires that on the tablet side a match between the scanned screen name and the available displays is found and resolved into a WIFI MAC ADDRESS. Such a matching [happens here](https://github.com/ZebraDevs/mcs_lumos_zwds_samples/blob/9441f2de9272907c92a3e0b9d99758bb8dfb42ba/Developer_Sample/DeveloperSample/app/src/main/java/com/zebra/zwds/developersample/Utils.java#L47), and is followed by a connection attempt with `DeveloperService.connectDevice(...)`.

Previously, the ZWDS was initiated in the Home Activity/initializeView() method, and the display scan was performed upon entering the SCAN TO CONNECT activity in 
ScanConnectActivity.java/onCreate/DeveloperService.startDisplayScan()

### TAP TO CONNECT
This use case is based on NFC tapping. On tablets the NFC antenna in located in the middle of the screen glass. So _tapping_ results in a rather weird action like this...

<img width="491" height="384" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/327903f6-6d0f-41ff-a1d3-ee0206cfa730" />

The TapConnectActivity.java file controls the NFC action and the onTagDiscovered callback assigns the `targetDockName = new String(payload, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);` the program flow is then merged into the calls previoulsy described for other use cases.

---

## Best practices 

Before calling the CONNECT API, always check the ZEC500 display properties. The properties “CanConnect” and “IsAvailable” should be true to call the connect API to function and establish the connection of host with the ZEC500 Display. 

Also, before calling the CONNECT API, make sure to call the “Start Scan” first, then call “Stop Scan” after establishing the connection, to minimize the resource usage. 

While exiting from the app, make sure to call the “DEINIT_DEV_SERVICE” API to clear the ZWDS. Otherwise, it will not be possible to other apps to call “INIT_DEV_SERVICE” successfully. 

---

## Known Behavior 

If the device is kept in idle mode for a longer time (more than 1 hr), ZWDS Api calls may not work as expected. It is needed disable and reenable the wi-fi as a workaround.

Calling the “DEINIT_DEV_SERVICE” API does not disconnect the existing connection session. If it is needed to disconnect the session, call the disconnect API before calling the “DEINIT_DEV_SERVICE” API. 

If ZWDS runs in non-secure mode, it will not validate any token sent by the calling app and will not show any error messages related to secure tokens. 

Once a connection is established with the ZEC500 device, if it is again called, the API Connect. It will disconnect the existing connection. 

---

Enjoy this new ZEC500 experience!
